\section{Statistical}
Statistical redundancy is present in all those sequences of symbols
where we can infeer a probability of ocurrence of a symbol
taking into consideration the rest of symbols of a
sequence. Statistical redudancy can be found in text, audio, image and
video, among other types of signals.

Statistical redundancy can be removed by text compressors.

\section{Temporal}
Temporal redundancy is shown by sequences of samples when those
samples are similar in value and when paterns of samples tend to
repeat. Temporal redundancy is found in all those time-dependant
signals, such as audio and video, among others.

Temporal redundancy can be removed by most audio and video codecs.

\section{Spatial (2D)}
Spatial redundancy is present basically in images, because pixels tend
to be similar to their neighbors or tend to repeat textures. See
Fig~\ref{fig:correlacion_lena}.
